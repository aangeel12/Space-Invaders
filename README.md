# space-invaders

This is the final project I completed for the Google-Sponsored Computer Science Computing Initiative (CSSI). I collaborated with another team member: Mason Allred.
We used the p5 javascript library to build a Galaga-like game that has enemies raining down on your spaceship. As you destroy more, a larger swarm appears. You must destroy as many enemies as you can. The left and right arrows are used as movement going side to side, and the upper arrow key is used to shoot towards your enemies.
If you would like to setup and run this project, you can download the repository and open the index.html file in a web browser.
